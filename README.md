# campfire-coffee
Repo for 201d5 week 2 class project
This is my README file

1) Created an app.js page for the campfire coffee website.

2) Used a constructor function called "Kiosk" that calculates an estimate for total beans by pound for each kiosk location

3) Experimented with some css styling which included looking at other websites snd trying to figure out similar techniques to use for this project.

4) Created a data html page to show daily totals for the various locations that also gives the user the ability to show data for new locations

5) Used one of the sweet logos created by David Heyduck.
